# assert-throws

%NPM: assert-throws%

`assert-throws` is an assertion method for Node.js which checks if a synchronous or asynchronous function throws. It can also compare properties of the error (such as `message`, `code` and `stack` and any other) with expected ones using string strict equality, a regular expression, or a function.

```
yarn add -E assert-throws
```
